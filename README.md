# Data-Engineer-Project
Aim is to clean data, and make it ready for automation within the ETL space.
Please process and transform the files received from the client into ingest-ready files using Python
and pandas in a Jupyter Notebook.
How can you ensure that your processing logic can be re-used for regular, efficient
refreshes of data?
Consider how these files might be related to one another. What could you do to test for
this?
